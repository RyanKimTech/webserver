      <h1>Deploying NetAlertX as a Virtual Machine on My Proxmox Cluster</h1>
      <p class="meta">By Ryan Scott Kim</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        NetAlertX has become one of my favorite tools for keeping a pulse on my home network. Instead of running it on a Raspberry Pi or as a lightweight container,
        I deployed it as a dedicated virtual machine inside my Proxmox cluster. This approach gives me more control over performance, storage, and reliability,
        and it integrates cleanly with the rest of my homelab infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project highlights how I designed, deployed, and optimized NetAlertX as a VM, and how it now serves as a centralized monitoring dashboard
        for all connected devices in my environment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why run NetAlertX as a VM?</h2>
      <p>
        NetAlertX is flexible — it can run on Docker, bare metal, or small single-board computers — but running it as a VM on Proxmox offered several advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Resource isolation:</strong> Guaranteed CPU and RAM allocation for consistent performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Snapshot support:</strong> Easy rollback during configuration changes or upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized management:</strong> Managed alongside the rest of my homelab VMs.</li>
        <li><strong>High availability options:</strong> Ability to migrate the VM across nodes during maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Better storage options:</strong> Using ZFS-backed storage for reliability and checksumming.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treating NetAlertX as a first-class VM gives it the same level of resilience as my other critical services.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>VM configuration on Proxmox</h2>
      <p>
        I created a lightweight Ubuntu Server VM dedicated to NetAlertX with the following specs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 vCPUs</li>
        <li>2–4 GB RAM (tunable depending on load)</li>
        <li>20 GB ZFS-backed virtual disk</li>
        <li>VirtIO network interface for low overhead and good performance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the VM was online and updated, I installed Docker and deployed NetAlertX inside a container on that VM.
        This setup gives me the convenience of Docker with the isolation, snapshots, and storage management of a full virtual machine.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>NetAlertX setup and optimization</h2>
      <p>
        After deployment, I configured NetAlertX to monitor my entire network, including multiple VLANs and segmented subnets routed through my pfSense gateway.
        The goal was to build a single pane of glass for device activity, changes, and anomalies.
      </p>

      <h3>Device discovery and tracking</h3>
      <p>
        NetAlertX continuously scans the network and logs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>New devices joining the network</li>
        <li>MAC and IP address changes over time</li>
        <li>Vendor identification based on MAC addresses</li>
        <li>Online/offline history for each device</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This gives me a real-time view of everything that connects to my environment and helps validate that segmentation is working as intended.
      </p>

      <h3>Alerting and notifications</h3>
      <p>
        I configured alerts for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unknown or unclassified devices</li>
        <li>Devices appearing on the network outside expected hours</li>
        <li>Network changes or anomalies that might indicate misconfigurations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These alerts have already helped me catch misconfigured IoT devices and DHCP issues before they turned into bigger problems.
      </p>

      <h3>Dashboard customization</h3>
      <p>
        I customized the NetAlertX dashboard to surface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High-value devices (firewall, core services, storage)</li>
        <li>Network segments grouped by VLAN</li>
        <li>Historical trends for device presence</li>
        <li>Device categories such as IoT, user devices, servers, and lab gear</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Running NetAlertX on a VM gives me enough headroom to keep the dashboard responsive even during more intensive scans.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Integration with the Proxmox cluster</h2>
      <p>
        Running NetAlertX on Proxmox ties it into the rest of my homelab lifecycle. I treat it like any other important service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Snapshots:</strong> I take snapshots before major updates or configuration changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> The VM is included in my regular Proxmox backup schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> I can migrate the VM between nodes during host maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Proxmox’s built-in metrics help me track CPU, memory, and disk usage over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This integration means NetAlertX benefits from the same operational discipline as the rest of my infrastructure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>
        This project reinforced several skills I care about as a builder of reliable systems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing lightweight, service-focused VMs that are easy to manage and back up.</li>
        <li>Running Docker-based workloads inside virtualized environments without losing observability.</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting network discovery across VLANs and routed subnets.</li>
        <li>Structuring monitoring tools as long-lived, production-style services rather than “lab experiments.”</li>
        <li>Integrating third-party tools into an existing Proxmox and pfSense-based homelab architecture.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also underscored how valuable it is to treat even “small” monitoring services with production-grade practices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        NetAlertX now runs as a stable, reliable VM in my Proxmox cluster, providing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time device monitoring and discovery</li>
        <li>Historical tracking of when devices appear and disappear</li>
        <li>Automated alerts for unexpected changes and unknown devices</li>
        <li>A centralized, visual dashboard for network visibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This setup has become a core part of my homelab observability stack and continues to evolve as I refine my network design.
